// Program to calculate the net salary that is based on basic salary and the benefits included  when applying PAYE,SHIF, and NSSF deductions.
//Gross salary is then calculated by program ,it applies the PAYE tax bonds, and deducts SHIF and NSSF contributions

//final output includes the gross salary ,PAYE tax,SHIF,NSSF,and net salary
